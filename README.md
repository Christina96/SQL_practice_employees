# SQL_practice_employees
 Here's a SQL query for practice with a database of employees of a company. The queries are more optimized for readability and can easily be translated into Tableau for visualization purposes.

#Task_1
I create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 

#Task_2
I compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

#Task_3
I Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002.

#Task_4
I Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.
